# Odin-Terminal-Chess

This is a very simple implementation of the classic chess game on a ruby terminal.
There is some functionality that has been left out
+ The program doesn't automatically check for a "check" or "checkmate" but the player can manually call a checkmate by pressing "c" on the keyboard.
+ There is a problem where the knight is allowed to move over other pieces.
+ Castling and pawn promotion have not been implemented (I know. Ghastly!)

Despite these problems if you are planning to try out the game, follow the simple steps below to play:
+ Download the code or clone into the repository
+ Use ```bundle install``` to install the necessary gems
+ Use ```ruby main.rb``` in the root directory to run the game
+ Have fun
